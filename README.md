# Videos Application

## Purpose of this applicaiton

This application was used to learn some of the lifecycle hooks React has to offer. We utilized componentDidMount() as well as Axios.create() to create a client. The project was done as a code along with Stephon Grider from his [Modern React with Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WcYCUISdVdRQQ==/).
